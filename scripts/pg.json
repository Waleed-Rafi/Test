So the weekday lifestyle is completely different to the weekend. The first thing to realise is that you can definitely enjoy yourself to the maximum without overdoing on alcohol on over eat and on weekends. Like, we have to accept that fact right now. Because if you think enjoying means overconsumption to the extreme, then you're going to be it's going to be very difficult for you actually, to start living in a moderate way. So the first thing to realise is, can you lose fat, and not hamper your performance and still drink alcohol? Right? That's a that's a big question. We know what excessive alcohol hsd really bad effects, right? There's no debate about binge-drinking and over drinking is going to have terrible consequences. But it's still up in the air, really was a moderate alcohol intake. And to do now, there are two interesting studies. And it's the first study is a moderate dose of one pint a day for women, and two pints a day for men. And they looked at their fat loss and kind of how they were feeling. And the research shows that there was no difference. It didn't hamper fat loss, didn't really impact them day to day, on that kind of two pints a day for men, one pint a day for women. Now another study was looking at the impact on performance, they put them through a training protocol. And the men would drink 666 millilitres a day. So the 330 millilitres  twice a day. And the women are drinking one 330 mil bottle of beer a day. And you know, they compared it to people drinking just water and all that. And again, no impact on performance. There wasn't, didn't go down, all performance went up. And that's from a moderate intake. So we know for sure, okay, they're a moderate intake of alcohol is not bad. It's not going to stop your fat loss, it's not going to make your training worse, right? Now, we have to accept the fact that a moderate amount is way less right than what we're used to drinking in the UK, what we're doing what we're used to drinking in the UK is a 10-15 drinks a day or night. There's just no need for if you really think about why you were drinking alcohol, you needed to understand what the purpose of it is, if you dig deeper into the reasons now, for me, when I was away a few months ago, in Europe, I was drinking the alcohol-free beers. And what I noticed for me was I didn't really need the alcohol, it was more about the kind of ritual the drink coming out cold ice-cold, the colour of the drink, the sun, my friends, you know, just chilling out talking, just have that social environment. That's what it is about me. But a lot of people drink alcohol to escape, or to get drunk enough to have confidence, or whatever it may be. And you've got to find the real real real, the real reason why excessive drinking is part of your way of living really. So I'm not saying at turtle we're not saying don't drink, we're not saying don't do these things. It's important to know right? What we're trying to say is figuring out why what is the core belief we have what is the conditioning we are under the causes us to excessively drink alcohol, and can we actually reduce our intake and still make progress and of course now the other part important part about alcohol is alcohol itself does include calories. So alcohol is technically the fourth macronutrient, and it has seven calories per gram. So it's quite calorie dense. And if you do drink alcohol, like a pint, you got you've got about  240 calories a pint. A bottle of white wine is about 650 calories, right? Some cocktails range from about 150 calories up to 600 calories for a pina colada. So definitely stay away from them. And really, it's about right, this, these drinks that I'm having, and I can moderate to them. If I over consumed them not only will I ever hang over the next day and that day is ruined. But I'm going to be consuming 1000s of calories by over drinking and that then is the cause of fat loss not happen because you are consuming a huge amount of calories and drinking, so I want you to try this weekend again as an experiment think of it all is an experiment Can I drink less drinks than usual? Can I opt for drinks that are better bang for buck bang for calorie right you look at gin slimline tonic, but 90 calories a drink right and again the water in with the alcohol think about it, you've got the alcohol, and you've got the water as well. So you have less of a hangover, and you got 90 calories you can have five, six of them right? And that's going to be a lot of alcohol because gin is, you know, quite strong versus a beer for example. But if you are going to drink you need to balance what I can drink moderately for me and the studies were looking at one or two drinks a day. So if you were you know taking 10 In one day is different, you can't just do that. Well if one a day for seven days you can have seven for men is two pints a day for two for seven days. So as for In 21 days, it's not the same doesn't work like that. But it's about making sure that you understand the impact and calories. And that's why in the app we are tasked today in the app is to find the drink you're drinking, if you are going to drink alcohol, not pushing anything, drink alcohol, of course. But if you are going to drink,go on search for your pint to put a Peroni in the search, then what in the app and as a video guide on this, you will see convert this to carbs are converted to carbs and fat. The reason we do this is that if you were to match up the calories of a drink, alcoholic drink, and then the macronutrient content, they won't match up because they don't show the amount of grams of alcohol in the drink. Okay, so there's a missing amount of calories and people goes empty calories. No, no, these calories do count, right? They're not empty calories. They're just calories and non nutritional benefit, basically. So what we do is, we look at the calories of a drink, and we'll convert it all to carbs, or carbs and fat. And then you can see the impact that a drink has on your macros. Okay, so you see the visual impact, because this is a big thing. If you can see the visual impact of the drink in terms of macros, then you start saying, Wow, okay, so one point is 240 calories, right. And that's about 50 to 60 grams of carbs, right, that's equivalent to like a bowl of oats, or whatever it may be, is equivalent to, you know, two protein bars or two Snickers bars or whatever you want to compare it all like one. So one Snickers bar everyone capacity, right? So then you can start having insights, this way, Visual Insight, as opposed to not really understanding the impact of house. Does that make sense. And as long as you track guys, this 14 Day experiment, you are tracking everything. And you have to be honest with this. Now, I get it, when it gets to a night out, and you just drink and drink and you don't understand how many drinks you've had the next day, you might be like, Oh, I have no idea how much how many drinks I add, so I can't track it. If you have the same drink, it's a lot easier to remember I'd go out and found point 2.3 points, four points, you know, to keep tabs and to try and estimate to the best of your ability and put it in the app. Okay. And as long as you put it all in the app, look, you're only cheating yourself by not being honest. And I know you can't be bothered to do it, it'll take you two or three minutes, just have a guess how many drinks to do are 567 10. You know, just have a guess put it in. It doesn't have to be perfect. But that app doesn't require perfection. This is the beauty of the app, it is built for imperfection of data. But if we can get as much data as we can, honestly, it's gonna work better and make changes for you. But we are adjusting based on data not being 100% accurate. Okay, we know this, like my fitness pal, for example. Thing requires you to have perfect data, it assumes you're tracking 100%, honestly, and all that stuff. And that's just not the truth. Right. And the final thing I want to mention today is if you have a takeaway, put it in the app, if the app doesn't have the exact takeaway put the closest possible thing, right. And you know, Tap the Guest Track button when you enter the food. So when you're going into the food that asks if you guessed it, well, it wouldn't be a guess. Because you're still young, you're going for the second best option and put gas in and then at least you're telling the app all these calories or guests do not bang on I know that because I'm not waded out, but it's my best guess. And with takeaways, again, looking into the numbers, luckily, there's calories and labels now, so we can see the truth of some of the foods we eat out. But takeaways, again, spend a few minutes looking at the nutritional information. And you can see all the eat out guides we've got. And all those foods are in the app as well. So look at the eater guides. And they'd be linked in the task today as well. So you can have a double check on them. And you start seeing like, wow, like that meal I have usually like 1400. But then the another meal I really like is x 650. I don't know, well, obviously I'll go for the 651 because then I can maybe have a dessert as well. Or maybe I can have that and a drink. And you have more bang for your buck. You know. And if you can do this day in day out more bang for your buck awareness. Honestly, tracking things will change fast for you, you'll get you'll improve massively, right? And that's all it's about. It's about can we be honest with ourselves day to day can we understand that we live in a world where food is abundant. The culture, especially in Britain is heavily reliant on drinking. Some of us want to quit drinking, some of us want to drink less. I don't think any of us want to drink more. So we still have to tackle this in a in an honest and in a way that is realistic. And understanding that the moderate intake isn't bad. So don't beat yourself up for drinking. So understand that a moderate intake is fine. And we have to find that balance and it won't happen overnight. It won't happen this weekend fully. But you will be aware of yourself this weekend. Why am I drinking more?","length":777,"tokens":173,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"alcohol on weekends","essay_url":"","essay_date":"January 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"Good morning, usually on weekends, people tend to go a bit crazy a bit loose on everything.
