{"current_date": "2023-03-14", "author": "Turtle Brain", "url": "", "length": 51258, "tokens": 9996, "essays": [{"title": "Strength Seminar", "url": "", "date": "January 2023", "thanks": "", "content": "David Nolan  2:45  Sounds good. And even the injury is wanting it even improves running performance. Strangely enough, when we look at something called running economy, which is much oxygen. And when you run that after strength training, economical and you're running, so use options when you're running. Yeah, check that out and stuff like that.David Nolan  3:43  So I'd consider that that is fine. Even if we look at the recommended guideline guideline. So even if you look at the governmental guide guidelines come down from the now every country has their own, but they all originate from the World Health Organization on the comedown that the current recommendations are that adults should engage in 150 minutes of moderate vigorous exercise per week, including two to three strength sessions, working on strength mobility. So that's pretty much in line with the World Health Organization's guidelines and what how much exercise we should be doing on a weekly basis.David Nolan  4:23  But it's like everything, you know, it's it's about starting at the appropriate level and then gradually building up over time like we're training, what we're doing is we're putting a stress on our body, and we hope that our body adapts positively to that stress. Now, it's a very delicate balance with stress application because, say when we talk about elite performance athletes, when we don't apply enough stress or appropriate amount of stress, we leave games on the table so they couldn't, might have got better. But an injury occurs when we place too much stress on the body for the handle at any one time. So at the extreme end, a born brain because we put too much for somebody who can't handle at a certain angle or something like that, soft tissue injuries, sort of, you know, strains niggles, groin issue hips, there tend to be a low thing we put too much stress in forms of Lord in terms of miles or time on a too quickly, or, you know, adaptation takes time. I've said plenty times where people try to rush fitness too often and you can't have a baby in four and a half months by trying twice as hard. You know, I mean, adaptation takes time. And time is one of those things or when you try to rush the process, bad things usually happen.David Nolan  6:31  Yeah, pretty good. I really loved it. It made me realize how much I enjoy doing strength training. Like now I feel quite addicted to it. Yeah, I really, really enjoy it. I didn't manage to finish the whole program because stuff happens that kind of derailed me. But I got up to like, week three, and I couldn't believe how quickly my like muscles were improving how much stronger I was getting. Like from week to week, and the Dom's got less. I saw like I saw massive improvements in just a really short space time. And I didn't finish it. So that's saying something. I think if I'd finished it, I would have been like, draw super strong. But yes, that's why I'm even more determined this time to actually like see it all the way through. I'd love to see like, what I'm capable of, I really focus.Brilliant. I think it's a good point there. And maybe for people that are starting strength training for the first time you highlighted the DOMs. So that dumbs when we talk about that muscle soreness or delayed onset muscle soreness does ease after the first week, you know, mean, people should be expect to be sore when we do something novel and new on our bodies. But it does get easier, I promise.David Nolan  9:18  I suppose that's a prospective thing, though, as well, in terms of that shows your progress in terms of the level of effort you put in is the same every week, but it's you're doing more for the same level of effort. So yes, you perceive it to be just as difficult week after week, but the weight you're using are heavier, you're doing more reps and more sets for that same perceived effort. So suppose keeping that perspective in mind is is important and as well.David Nolan  10:06  And with that, like, all get into it, because it's complicated, but the expression of strength in terms of lifting heavy near maximal weights that kind of want three reps is a skill in itself to express your strength. So the way we develop it sometimes and express it are different. But what you will do then, is this more strength hypertrophy side of things that we're at moment, and then a few weeks of training yourself back into, okay, I need to lift heavier again, a few weeks of retraining that skill is then you would notice kind of this potensi ation effect where the high reps for a time, then into lower reps, then testing at the end of that would probably lead to the most most benefit, I suppose, or increase in strength.Question: Would you? Would you recommend at all, if there is a chance to do a fourth lifting day a week? Or every so often, would you recommend incorporating those big lifts in just to keep them up or?David Nolan  11:09  Yeah, so if that if that's something that you you have experience with and is a priority of yours in terms of the amount of weight, you can lift on a bar, and you do want to do a four session week, something like that could be to keep, as you said, to keep that skill alive over there, because you're developing the strength and hypertrophy with the sessions were doing. And then that fourth session could keep the skill there. Like, what we would do in a powerlifting context, and would actually do the heavy single sometimes is what we do, where the mic when workup to a heavy session of one on a squat at like an RPh or something, and then to do three sets of sixes or back offsets or just doing that heavy single to keep the skill of lifting heavy there. And then the actual development is happening in the three sets of six on the back off. So yeah, if you have a Ford session, maybe working up to just one or two heavy sets in each of those lifts could be beneficial for you if that's kind of a goal for you.Unknown Speaker  12:09  And would you keep it to sort of the main ones, or do you recommend any particular ones? So sort of squat? deadlift bench? I mean?David Nolan  12:19  Yeah, they're your main ones. They promised you like you're getting a lot of the same benefits from the squat, similar movement in terms of their hip extension is the main, I'm going action going on there. So I would say especially since it's a fourth session, now at work up to a heavy squat, heavy deadlift and heavy bench, that'd be more than enough. You don't want to overdo it either. Okay, brilliant. Thank you.Unknown Speaker  12:45  Happy days. And let's get some questions in a box know who you once you know, you know, the basis of who wants big glutes who wants, you know, what's the goals? Use quad definition? Like what is people's aims for training here, Louise? Do we want to get stronger, of course, butDavid Nolan  13:01  you know, what else is new? Scott was a few questions came in, and he also quickly breeze through them. And then people can be drawn stuff into the chat that we got some minutes to think about that. So I'll just throw quickly up here on the screen those and beginning so where do I want to go, I want to put you there. Always, I have two screens at home here, too. And anyone that has dual monitors know when you're sharing your screen, it's always a nightmare of where to come up. That's not what I wanted to happen one sec. So I need to troll you over there. And enjoy Okay, that's not working for me. Well go here. So very quickly, guys, you can see my screen here is all looking after Presenter View AsUnknown Speaker  14:05  I can see all next slide on the right hand side.David Nolan  14:08  Perfect. So don't need to share the other screen. get the hang of it now. I need to share either Aha, no, no, we're going to work. So very quickly. I know some of you know me for the last challenge. But just in case you are new here this time a very brief introduction to myself and by arrogant enough to think there are one or two things about strength training. So career wise, I do quite a quite a few different things. I'm currently finishing off my PhD in applied Sport Sciences at Dublin City University and I research sex differences in resistance training. So I look at the kind of question do females respond differently to males in exercise? And do females need to train differently and some of the stuff around the role of menstrual cycle hormonal contraceptives all these do, they have Fact exercise. So that's kind of my research interests academically. I also lecture in a few different places and most probably, I lead a Master's course in sports performance analysis at portabello Institute. I am the co director of diverse strength division network. And then I am also used to be s&c and now director of education at RubyConf, Maryland. And then consultancy wise, I work with athletes from from different backgrounds, different sports and different organizations through my consultancy, synapse performance. And so again, mainly feel based sports, but also some high level combat sport athletes and as well, from my own sport and experience, I compete in powerlifting. So the squat, the bench and the deadlift for anyone to do is know those three exercises alone, if you want to call that a sport, that's pretty much my sport. And three exercises is the sport I compete in. And so that is kind of my background, in terms of some of the questions we got into semen. So three came in, and two around kind of the postpartum side of stuff. So this one, this person is almost a year postpartum, I'm struggling a bit to know what delimiter used to be very fit, but some debilitating pelvic and hip pain, from early exercise, and sometimes or from every pregnancy is sometimes paired up by axes. Now, what I will say is, we're lucky enough to have Emma Dolan on this challenge, or pre and postnatal specialists. So these are questions that I would divert to to Emma, I know a person she's excellent at what she does. And so obviously, this person has acknowledged that sort of talking about this. But if that's enough strength training, again, you're doing building up to 10k, and you're doing the two classes with me, that's gonna be pretty much enough if you are going from relatively low amounts of exercise to get them back into it, again, with pain and something like this. Once you have medical clearance to go back, that's fine. That if the exercise tends to flare it up, you just have to identify the patterns, what type of exercise flares up, what volume, if I do have to session for the full session, is it flared open, just finding where works best for you. And now there's very few cases in which we should avoid exercise altogether, that that exercise will be contraindicated. So, a lot of time, a low level of discomfort or low level of pain associated with exercise in terms of niggles, say, two or three hour 10, on the pain scale is perfectly fine. And will tend to ease itself with more exercise. So again, I'm not completely answering that question, but chat to me about this. And also Dr. P, on the nutrition he know many people know his PhD is in rehabilitation, as well around joint rehabilitation. So he will have some insights on this as well.That's that question. This one now, how do you know when you should progress the way. So the way we have structured it is we're working for 60 seconds. Now, we are recommended a tempo that you should be lowering the waist, the centric face for three seconds, about a one second pause, or and one second concentric, where you're pushing, and then maybe one second pause between reps. So a rep roughly should take six seconds, and five to six seconds, depending on your tempo. So that means in 60 seconds, you should be able to complete 10 to 12 reps. If you're completing more reps and that necess you're going too fast. So what you need to do is once you're able to complete 10 to 12 reps with good technique using the right tempo in a set, well, that means it's time to probably go heavier. The next you go heavier, the next session, you might do get a rep stone and that 60 seconds, you're not able to do anymore, whatever and then you try to progress it on that way. So it's best if you're able to 10 to 12 reps with good technique in the 60 seconds for all your sets, then it's ready to move up the weight. And again, you don't have used the same way it's for every set, like if we're doing two sets and as we progress three sets per exercise, you could use a heavyweight for the for session. So say for example, this week, you're able to use five kilos per hand and you got the 12 reps in bought sets. Well next week, we've said okay, I want to go to seven kilos for the first session. See if I can get the 10 reps you might only get eight. And then I'm going to drop back to five kilos for the second session and get the 10 to 12 reps so you can have those options and as well, so I hope that explains it. And then finally, another person with pelvic pain after birth to daughter and walking Making the pain worse. So is there any advice around strength training. So, depending on the difficulty of the birth, whether there was the degree of tearing, and if any, and how long after the birth, there are some considerations there. But generally, you know, hip pain might several reasons that can cause it. And Emma, again, is wanting to talk about this after birth. But a lot of what we need to do in the postnatal period is tightening everything back up, re re educating, and some of the muscles to work into it should, but also increasing pelvic floor strength, increasing the strength around the groin, and hips, and other muscles there. So, advice on how to train with it. We've suggested regressions and adaptations that can be done to the exercises. And you can ask us if any particular exercises you're having difficulty with, we'll find a way of adjusting it for you. But basically, all we're ever looking to do is a little bit of discomfort, maybe, okay, maybe, if there's something that causes pain, we find a way that we complete the exercise, while keeping the pain kind of below a three or four hour 10 is generally a rule of thumb that we do. And that might be a postural thing, it might be by elevating or, depending on the exercise by using an elevation, or something like that, we can adjust it now augment it for you. So if there's particular exercises you're struggling with, please do send us a message and I will help find what works best for you. So those are the three quick questions that came in. And a brief introduction to myself case. I don't know if we have any questions have come through ScottUnknown Speaker  21:47  flear, about some luck. Okay, so Mr. Dean, go on, you're on the rap side. So if we're doing between 111 to 13 reps per set, we should go up. And if we're doing 16 reps, and we stick to the wayDavid Nolan  22:03  we're doing 16 reps, you're doing too much.Unknown Speaker  22:06  Too excited, Emma. Yeah. It's hard. It was hard David is to count the reps you're doing whilst keeping tempo. So very difficult actually, to do it and actually then be able to write down what you just did. So to learn the tempo without actually count dinner is probably important. Yeah.David Nolan  22:26  Yeah, that's true. And it's something you probably said like see you and I will take for granted now at this stage is it's unconsciously we just know that the temple we're going out and kind of dial in. So that's a very, very good point. And I'm trying to think if you just focus on the tempo, the court is probably, you know, I mean, if you are keeping the perfect tempo, the coach will tell you under 60 seconds, is up means you've done your 12 Five or 12 or 10 or 12, I should say. Whatever it may be, but yeah, what is the scale it becomes easier to think and counted same time? Yeah, nice. Thing is a few first of all,Unknown Speaker  23:10  yeah, just just growing the glutes and kind of, you know, the word in used around you, you know, toning and wanting to get glutes back and Pooky but shaping the muscle. And also you mentioned before David by like the muscle can only get bigger or smaller it can.David Nolan  23:27  Yeah, this idea of toning again, that's a colloquialism I suppose that we use are the binocular for the muscle itself, the shape that can change but in terms of this tone, our muscles when we are born, they attack shut apartments are two points, a muscle obviously just stretches from one point to another and contracts between those two points. We can't, it's genetically predisposed, where those muscles attach. The bicep is a good example usually, and it's more prominent in males, but some people have bicep that is quite large and attaches very close to elbow. But you'll see other people have kind of these golf ball, biceps, that's just a golf ball at the top of the arm kind of thing where again, and you have you can search Google and there'll be these of you train this way to make it go further down your arm, which, again, is bullshit. It's unfortunately we're just built that way in terms of the muscle. So what can we do in terms of the appearance of a muscle? So toned, usually means you know farm and shapely is generally what we are talking about when we talk more terms that we can. It's relatively lean, defined and shapely. So when we are looking for that, we have two options. We can make the muscle bigger, or we can remove fashio that's over the muscle through diet and exercise. And that's that's pretty much as we can do boredom similar fantasy is the the ideal scenario. Or for example, if your arm is not toned, you either have to make the muscle bigger that it is more prominent and it looks more toned, or you have to reduce overall body fat stat is rubbish bit leaner on the muscle is more visually. It's more, I won't say aesthetically, but it's more prominent, visually prominent. And now what I will say is, a lot of people don't realize that if you gain muscle, so if you work on strength training and hypertrophy training, and hypertrophy founders know is just to grow the muscle, it's the fancy word we use to make ourselves sound smarter, but it's just muscle building is hypertrophy. You think about it, if you were to gain two kilos of muscle, and the amount of body fat that's in your body said the exact same. So say for argument's sake, you would 20 kg of body fat in your body. If you gain two kg muscle and you stay at 20 kg body fat, you don't gain any body fat, well, then your body fat percentage, which is what we all know is, what kind of dictates how lean you are, people want to have a lower body fat percentage, by increasing muscle and keeping your fat mass the same will then rel relative to your overall weight, your body fat percentage is actually decreased. And when body fat percentage decreases, you visually look leaner. So that's why to get leaner and to look leaner, we don't have to always lose body fat, just by even gaining muscle, it will bring down our body fat percentage, which visually will make a big difference and as well. So it's just a mindset thing to get into that we don't always have to be focused on on fat loss in order to make a biggest static difference. Now, obviously, the biggest ecstatic difference comes when you gain muscle and lose fat. So you're hitting it from both ends, essentially, that you know, you're less layers of fat on top of the muscle, bigger muscle presses up against the skin better, you look more athletic, more lean and more toned. Pretty much it in terms of the boom, again, people are more well says people like okay, well I just need to reduce the fashio on my arm doesn't work that way, in terms of our bodies, quite cruel, that we cannot spot reduce. So just by training your arms more doesn't mean that you're going to lose the fat from your arms. And when we lose body fat, we can't control where we lose it from. And again, with both males and females, it tends to be the last place or the first place you want it to go from tends to be the last place it goes from. So you know, I mean, our bodies hold fast, where it seems essential that it needs it. And in females, it's particularly around sexual organs around the hips. And the lower abdomen is tends to be where the majority of that fashio is held on to, for obvious obvious reasons. It's trying to insulate and protect the sexual organs. And so hips, glutes, everything like that. So it can be oftentimes one of the last places, if you're trying to get really lean, that tends to lose fat fromand in terms of the bone or the glutes, as we call them. So it's always a big target muscle that people want to develop. Even in athletes. It's when we talk about sprinting and jumping a lot of its comes from the glutes. So when we talk about building a muscle people often forget, you just need to think about what the function of a muscle is. And, for example, I'll throw that out there. Can anyone tell me? What do the glutes do? Like if I asked you what the biceps do, everyone knows the bends your elbow pulls your arm? What are the glutes responsible for what movements? Do the glutes do? Everyone's talking and everyone's muted.Unknown Speaker  29:11  Because mine says yep. Pendency sitting, lifting your leg.David Nolan  29:17  lifting your leg? In what way? Do you want to demonstrate Emma? Is thisUnknown Speaker  29:27  or is it more can you mean? Ah?David Nolan  29:29  Now, if we talk about lifting the leg again, let's think about it. Both sweet muscles do one thing. They shorten between two points to contract. That's all a muscle can do. It can contract and relaxed. When we lift the leg. What's the most saloon? What's the glutes tune. Loads are stretching so they're not contracting. They're not working. They're stretching. So that means it's the hip flexors at the front your leg, flex the hip pull up the leg so We can think about it, if that's the movement, so when you lifted your leg, you see it stretch. But then when they contract, it's the opposite way. So it's a hip extension is what the glutes are for. That's why we do a hip thrust, or in that bottom position, and we're essentially coming up and trying to push your pelvis towards the roof. Now, that is the movement. And that's why we get that at a squash when we're coming up over squash or hips are bent under trying to push back through to try to push back through and under us. When we look at our hips, hip thrusts technique, we tend to see a lot of people and I'll get some graphics of next week, we'll break down the technique of this. But a lot of people don't get the full hip extension, hip trust, and that's where they're missing out on the glutes of because people lift really, really heavy weight in the hip trust, you see people with massive amounts of weight on the hip crossbar. For them, it's because they're relying a lot on the quads, the backs, the hip flexors, that kind of stuff. When a lot of times they don't actually use the glutes as much as they can, because the glutes in the hip trust, again, how I describe it, when I teach it to people is, you should never look attractive when doing a good hip trust. If, and you should look what was there. Now, again, if anyone finds me crass, please, please stop me. A good hip truss looks offensive. If you get what I mean, a good hip truss should look offensive, that at the top, you're coming, your hips are coming up. And there's kind of this perverted, squeezing the glutes and shoving of genitalia basically towards the roof of this, that final kind of kick in the hips is really what's needed from the glutes. So again, someone said aggressive, yeah, a good hip thrusts at the top looks aggressive and offensive. And I'll get some graphics and videos of that next week to show but it's that last few little inches of the movement can actually make a big difference in Litquake can make a big difference in terms of the glute activation. So again, a lot of time, little tweaks of technique can make a big difference. Now, I hope I hope that makes sense for people and I'm not boring people with the technicalities.Unknown Speaker  32:23  Make sense? Makes sense. Well, does anyone have any questions on our know if anyone is doing the work we did before. Octagon remember we did glute bridges into Single Leg Glute bridges who's doing them, and you didn't use any weight and it was killer bass, because you actually probably using your glutes for the first time properly as opposed to use an under key hip thrusts it did with this leg, the Single Leg Glute Bridge is so much harder than you think like is that I mean, my glutes are weak.David Nolan  32:57  Yeah, it's, it's it's a difficult one. So when we start a new exercise, and we're bad at it, it's for two reasons. It's the muscle is weak. So and the second one is, it's a new skill. These are new movements, you learn the first time do it the first time you you swing a golf club, maybe that's a bad analogy to use here. But you're bad at. And it's not because you're weak, you can't hit the ball far enough because your technique is poor, because it's a new skill and a motor pattern you're trying to develop. So in the first week or two, you're just getting used to doing the movement. And as you get better at learning the actual movement skill of movement, then you can get better and better at developing the mind muscle connection with the muscle and getting better at isolated muscle. And that's another reason why the progress we make in the first few weeks of training, a lot of it can be down to our nervous systems or our brain getting better at coordinating the signals and our movement becomes smoother. Now, if that takes a couple of weeks to happen, and you switch your exercises every four weeks, which a lot of people do, or even you're switching exercise all the time, you never give your body enough time to learn to movement smoothly. And then start to progress in terms of the muscle has to then take up the slack even more, where because of this, we've two blocks per made. You should be competent in the movements by the end of the first block. And then in the second block, you'll really be able to push on and isolate the muscle and feel the difference there. So yeah, that's it's two aspects. And then there's a lot more core stability needed in the single like hip thrust. Because again, with all these exercises, all we are ever doing is trying to resist gravity in one way or another gravity is trying to work against us unless we're using a band or a cable or something like that. But in the hip trust essentially what gravity is trying to do is push one side your hip down, so you have to use your core glutes and everything to keep yourself balanced and level throughout the movement and as well. So it's an additional challenge.Unknown Speaker  35:09  Make sense? Make sense? Any any questions or comments in the box? Or come on shop? But David, can you explain so our new people were strapped the difference between this type of strength training, which people might be like as a bit of the start, you may think is a bit boring compared to like, you know, those other fitness influencers who have those crazy workouts, like, you know, like the Courtney black and all those people just crazy high intensity workouts all the time over and over and over and over without real thought about the progressions like, what's the difference between that training and this style? For the people?David Nolan  35:43  Yeah, 100%. So in terms of like, what we're trying to do, am I still sharing my screen? Sorry, no, I stopped around, sorry, something popped up here. So yeah, that's difference between those are the two different qualities in terms of strengths is the ability of our muscles to exert force or to resist against things to push against in support, where that other stuff is high intensity, aerobic exercise, both training our heart and her lungs. And yes, you might feel a bit of burning in the muscle. But that burning is not because when you do high intensity, say cardio exercise, or you're doing, you know, air squats, for as far as you can zones, you can, your legs will burn, but strength probably isn't your limiting factor, it's actually your aerobic system is your limiting factor, because you get a buildup of lactic acid in these other things in the muscle, and it's really burned. And it's really difficult. But that's just your breathing, it can't clear it quick enough, essentially, without going into the, the details, where when you slow it down, focus on the lower high quality reps, the muscle strengths, the the fibers that make up per muscle day or workout challenge rather than the aerobic system predominately, so yes, you're always going to have a little bit of aerobic little bit of muscle working at all times no matter what you're doing. But when we focus on this, and we're challenging the most super saying that muscle fibers in it. And then the other element to it is in order to grow. And we'll cover next week in our in our seminar, in order to progress, we have to apply something called progressive overload, and he talks about that strength is just applying stress to the body, we break down the body a little bit and we recover, we get better. But when we get better, we're now fitter. So our bodies can handle a little bit higher level of stress. And so it's like if you're running, you go out the first time you do 10 minutes kills you, then a week or two later, while you're able to do 12 minutes, if you kept just doing 10 minutes, you're going to get to a stage where you don't really progress anymore. So it's the same with strength training, we need to keep increasing the amount of stress we place on the muscles over time because our muscles are able to handle it well. And then over time, we get this progressive overload by increasing directs increasing the sets increasing the amount of weight we use, and that leads to the muscle getting stronger and stronger and stronger. Where if we're doing the high intensity, you know, just gone 100% all the time. Well, first of all, we're starting to hide that we're using the aerobic system rather than the muscles per se. And where do you progress to you know mean there's no progression progression going on? So that's a whole again come clear next week in this seminar exactly what I mean when we dig into details, but I hope that answers it to a certain degree.Unknown Speaker  38:41  And nice it does it does. Who here hasn't done the work is trying to go anyone you're not? We've learned the older David we are 116 people live on Monday morning 6:30am Are you proud of them?David Nolan  38:57  I'm very proud. Oh my god you doing it? 630 day. Nice. I start work at 7am So just just getting over wasn't quite at that stage.Unknown Speaker  39:09  My sweat Okay, here's one I'm starting on five kg, which is heavy for me but just doable. How much weight should I be adding a week?David Nolan  39:17  It's that is how long is a piece of string. I can't give you exactly what you should be doing. We just want to continually progress and we don't want to progress week to week all the time. If it's about over the time that we are you know more demands are face to face that we are some degree of progression is going on. So it sounds that you're in the right place. So five kg heavy. We're just about do what? So next week, I believe we are adding another session I believe. So maybe keep five kg the same next week and see you because you won't be doing three sets with instead of two and say okay, if can I get through the three sets And is it slightly easier. So if you nail the three sets of five kg the whole way through, then the next week, go up to six, go up to seven, even if it's one or two sets, or I think we'll progress and reps after that, whatever it may be. So that's kind of where I be, we can progress in several different ways we'll talk with you. So you can add reps, you can add more ways, you can add another set, or what people tend to forget is you can do the same with reps and sets for better technique and better controller that is progression. If I'm able to, or same with the squat, if I'm only able to have the mobility to half squat this week, and then in two weeks time, I'm able to do a full squat. Well, you've gone twice the range of motion, so you've actually placed twice as much stress on your legs and glutes and everything per rep. So that's progression as well even if the way it says the same, but your range of motion becomes better or whatever it may be. That is progress as well. So I wouldn't get too bogged down in I have to go to a certain number. We don't need to chase certain numbers, we just chase progression in whatever form it comes to us in. Nice.Unknown Speaker  41:15  Hopefully the answer Tyler, I'll get off the answer. Anyone coming off mute? Yeah,David Nolan  41:22  Tyler's got it.Unknown Speaker  41:26  Oh, yeah, sorry. Yeah, that was really good. Um, yeah, cuz I'm not really used to wait. So. Yeah, that'd be really good. If I could do that.David Nolan  41:37  Fantastic. Well, when Welcome to the strand community.Unknown Speaker  41:42  Yes. Thailand, you know, you're on your first workout. Do you feel like the the like David was mentioning like the reps were done like fully and or some difficult and others and stuff? Like, I'll press up wise, what are you doing for that?Unknown Speaker  41:57  I was only doing the like baby press ups. And the when I was like doing it over my head, sometimes I just like jump a little bit to get over my head. Probably get used with like, getting used to the five kilogram first.David Nolan  42:11  Yeah, exactly. So if you were doing six reps today, with good technique, and you had to kind of jump to push the last few. Well, then the next week, I'm going to stick with five and see if I can do them all without the jump, or using control is where you would go. That's progression.Unknown Speaker  42:27  Yeah, it'd be good for it to be like,David Nolan  42:29  that'd be fun. Yeah. Where people make the mistake of, well, if I go to seven, and we see it even ego lifting, like ego is often the enemy of progress. That is not my cause. I forget, Scott, you're a man for the court, you might know who said that.Unknown Speaker  42:45  Ryan Holiday is going to book called Ego is the Enemy. So maybe it was?David Nolan  42:49  Yeah, it was probably somewhere in there. But it is true. Getting stronger, should be for everyone lifelong pursuit. And one of my main areas that I advocate for is older people and weightlifting. And I thought, like, I want to come through resistance training. My thing is everyone should strength train, be you 20 or 19. There's no reason not to be lifting weights. And it's beneficial for everyone. So getting stronger should be a lifelong pursuit. And with that, you have the next hopefully, for all you the next 50 6070 years to keep progressing, so we don't have to get there in 10 weeks. This is simply the start of the journey, hopefully for everyone.Unknown Speaker  43:38  Nice, Dave five benefits of strength training, and then for women, or just in general by setting specific ones for women, and we've got a top five.David Nolan  43:48  Okay, yeah. So let's see, for women specifically. So women, once we hit healthy aging starts in early life and people don't get the exercise and training we do in our early life has a massive knock on effect and to lead life. So some of the things that women are more prone to in the postmenopausal stage. So when we're perimenopausal and postmenopausal, we have a massive dip in estrogen levels after the menopause. One of the implications of that is estrogen is actually very important for calcium utilizations. One of the reasons that people around menopause and after menopause you're told to supplement with with calcium and vitamin D and Vitamin K. So women are really at risk of us developing osteoporosis and osteopenia. So that's just the bones getting more fragile and bone density going down. There's one thing that really works well to increase our bone density and that is resistance training, weight bearing training astronauts in space but Because of lack of gravity, they actually lose a lot of bone. And they will try in two to three hours a day in space, just to try and preserve the bone density. So that's the big one, it really significantly reduces your risk of osteoporosis for females, specifically, females tend to be at higher risk of joint injuries more specifically around the hip and knee, especially at knee. Anyone engaged in sport, females are about three times more likely to rupture an ACL than males a couple of reasons for that. It used to be tired about the cue angle, the angle of the hip. But the science infrequent out against that, it generally just seems because women are weaker. And now I don't say that, in a misogynistic way I even see it in Sport is men tend to culturally start lifting weights at a younger age. And females participate in sport tend to not engage in resistance training, or come to it much later in life. So therefore, they have a lower training age and haven't been doing it as long. But to try to play the exact same sport, they have the same demands on the body, and the knees aren't strong enough to handle it a lot of the time. So strength training for is going to reduce your risk of injury for if you play a sports. And also if you are a runner, it will reduce your risk of running related injuries. And as well, that's to try again, with the healthy agents of it, you live longer and you live a better quality of life. Do our levels of muscular strength is strongly associated with our quality of life and our quality of life. Even with COVID I don't like talking about now. But we actually saw people with higher levels of muscular strength had less risk of hospitalization and that should COVID. So being stronger, genuine genuinely, throughout our lifespan leads to better quality of life, and more independence. Like if you're not strong enough to sit, open down over chair by yourself when you're 70 or 80. You're not strong enough to go to the toilet by yourself, you need help. It's just not good, and it's a lower quality of life. Okay. People who are embarking on weight loss journeys and fat loss doors, who engage in resistance training exercise, tend to have better outcomes than those engaged just robic exercise alone. So tends to lead to superior or at least matched weight loss outcomes compared to cardio. And okay, fifth, let me see what would be good for both why people should strength train makes you look jacked. Who doesn't want to look jacked? I don't know. Like, you don't get bigger glutes from Ronan.Unknown Speaker  47:53  Davino as a question if you do it. So if you've gone through the menopause, this let's see if I'm good for you to weight train.David Nolan  48:00  Yes, 100%. And it's strongly strongly advised. Like with everything, it's once you start at the appropriate level and gradually build up. It's strongly strongly advised. There's, I've had women in there well into their 80s, I started on resistance training programs, and have reaped the benefits of it. It's never never too late to start resistance training or strength training.Unknown Speaker  48:27  David, you see a study done on resistance training on older women with Alzheimer's and dementia. You see no one?Unknown Speaker  48:34  Yeah, that's one of Australia.Unknown Speaker  48:38  It was my shoulder everyday revert, in a sense, low down brain, you know, dementia allows me in some cases, improved it or reversed it?David Nolan  48:47  Yeah, we did some of that at TCU. We saw it was resistance training seems to have a strong effect on cognitive ability, then as well, it improves. Now all exercise do it's not just resistance or resistance seems to have a good effect on on dementia thing. And again, when you strength train, don't forget that the signals for your muscles move all originates in the brain, be it for running or for weight training, the signals have to come from the brain and as well, so the brain is always going to to be involved. And then because strength training can often be done in the gym environment or in a community based setting. It oftentimes brings a social aspect to it as well, which when we talk about cognitive ability and dementia risk and dementia, rate of decline dementia related rate of decline. People who have increased socialization tend to see better outcomes there then as well again, not not my domain. I don't want to talk too much about that kind of site itself, but it does seem to benefit us. It's the same way with metabolics of so diabetes, anyone that's diabetes or pre diabetic resistance training tends to be very effective for improving glucose tolerance. And yeah, um, blood glucose tolerance.Unknown Speaker  50:11  Sounds good. Sounds good, too good to be true the strength training did you ever saw? Yeah, well, it'sDavid Nolan  50:16  it's a thing that, again, I My hope for people probably can't see me too well on the camera, but for the sake of my fragile ego, that people can see that I prefer resistance training, to cardio. But it's not one or another. I'm not bias Bosch are important. And we'll look at some research next week. But when we look at people who engage in aerobic exercise, so and meet the guidelines, so get 150 minutes a week, and don't get their strength, they tend to see a I think, a 17% reduction in mortality risks, or people just dying from diseases, when you hit your 70, or your 150 minutes 70% reduction in the risk of dying, those who only meet their strength requirements, that they get to three strength training sessions in a week, they see a 21% reduction in risk of death. So do you see superior benefits compared to cardio. Now, people who get bought the cardio and strength, they see a 29% reduction in this particular study that we'll talk about next week. So those who do both see the biggest benefit, but doors if you had to choose one or the other. I would say if you said I've only three sessions to train per week, card me I would say do strength training for three sessions. Because you can if you can keep your daily activity and your step count I that tends to look after your cardio metabolic side to health so your heart, your lungs and stuff like that. But then two or three gym focus structured sessions should be predominately strength based.Unknown Speaker  52:02  Make sense? To me make sense to me, everyone. Does this make sense to you will make sense here. We are pumped with the decision to transfer in and out for the next 10 weeks.Unknown Speaker  52:12  And is around week five or six?Unknown Speaker  52:16  Yeah, I went to the gym with Ryan to do the first session yesterday and he's on his way back and we have to lower the benchpress day or two you're gonna hit 60 kgs. But yeah, for 60 seconds. That's bad.Unknown Speaker  52:30  That's bad enough. That's the that's the classic question isn't how much itUnknown Speaker  52:35  was only about 100 110 kgs I never go above it. David. I was plateauing because I wasn't following programming properly. So I feel like still respectable. Ryan's is 162 good bench and he never program so I keep saying really Ryan imagine you follow the actual program properly like Teva. John, you can you can explore so we're doing on our track and his progresses he was going to get out of it. So be interesting to see.David Nolan  53:01  Definitely. What about your squat and deadlift? Yeah, man for that.Unknown Speaker  53:05  Yeah, my squat. I once did 170 minutes. Nice. And then deadlift only demonstrated maybe, maybe? I don't know. Well, actually, I've never found like, I don't know if anyone else you got lower back problems. There was a comment in the, in the in the chat box of a lower back on some exercises. I always found that agitated Nancy to nominal day. To me. So my is that I think I saw a physio, maybe some a lower abdomen in my pelvis or whatever is very weak.David Nolan  53:39  So position potentially, someone did ask about a remember tips on Romanian deadlift, I think and lower back. So a lot of times with the RDL. When we see lower back discomfort, it can be a technique thing. So I'll hopefully I'll put it up in slides, I'll make a note of it with the Romanian deadlift. Again, what is our goal and if you think about this, in terms of where a muscle begins and ends, its advanced, it's nerdy, but this is what I think about the hamstrings is what we're looking to mainly work in a Romanian deadlift. And they're what we call a by articulate muscle, which again, is just a fancy way of saying it crosses two joints. So our hamstrings starts at pretty much our lower back because Prosser hip and then across our knee and attaches to the top of our calf. So if we're looking to stretch that muscle to the full capacity, are essentially trying to get the two ends of it as far away from each other as possible. Now, what people tend to do is to just bend from the back for what we're trying to do in their RDL is not bend forward. We're actually trying to push our hips back as far as we can backwards and actually create the biggest distance between the two ends of the muscle. So if you are someone that if you want to see well do I do the RDL properly about four to five inches in front of a wall. And when you're already Ellen, your bot should be touching off the wall. If your bot is not touching off the wall, that means you're bending just from the hips forward, bending from the backs rather than pushing the hips back. So you want to start your position few inches in front of the wall and focus on I'm not it's not about bending forward to keeping my my chest up straight, my body straight and pushing my hips back as far as they can behind me by bending over. So that's essentially what we're doing to troubleshoot afterward.Unknown Speaker  55:35  Nice. Do you have any other visualizations for? So like Ryan's like close? Accardo? Yeah, I don't know. Like, what are the ones? Yeah,David Nolan  55:41  that's that's pretty much what you're talking about those type of cues. If you wanted to test it, I just stand in front of what? So someone has tested positive for, for COVID. Sorry, sorry to hear that. But alas, that's, I think the fate is destined to us all. But hopefully, you're feeling better. And we'll be able to get into the strength training soon. But as I said, people who are stronger tend to do better with COVID. And as well.Unknown Speaker  56:11  Yes, yes. And we've got pulled a tomorrow. So there will be a lot of this pelvic tilt movements. So any, any tips day before activating the lats for people because I know a lot of men like doing big back exercises. But in general, when it comes to women don't really delve much into like the big back exercises. So what like things can we say to trigger the lats?David Nolan  56:38  So the lats essentially, the latter difficult one, and to take time to learn how to use us properly. But what we can do is a surrogate kind of movement, if we focus on what our shoulder blades doing and kind of our shoulders, it can be an easy way to do it. So when we are pulling back percent, you're trying to squeeze your shoulder blades and pulling movement. When we're pulling back, you're trying to either for different people or work better, you're trying to squeeze your your shoulder blades, if you're trying to squeeze the coin behind them, or most people respond best to is your elbow, you're trying to pull your elbow behind you and push your elbow as far as you can. So if I'm, if I'm pulling here, it's about you picture that you're not pulling from the hand, rather than you're pulling from the elbow, your hand is just holding on to the weight. But it's the elbow is what you're trying to bring behind you. So you know you're pulling, don't think of squeezing the biceps, because people tend to squeeze to shorten the squeeze in like this, where if I just focus on, it's the elbow was going behind, you get a better rowing movement. And that's something and also when we go forward. So a lot of people don't go forward enough. So obviously, the people think that the scapula has to be set back, and we just move like this. But really what we wanted a full stretch that were forward like that to the scapula goes the full way, and then comes back the full way. But it's important to that, why are you keeping the chest and back straight the mistake people make is when does capital forward they allow the back around with it. That's not what we're looking for. We want the chest to stay a stretch, but the scapular to move. Now, I hope that angle was okay for the camera guy didn't just make a fool of myself. Not there's laughing I don't know if she laughing at me or what's going on.Unknown Speaker  58:34  Last re release, I actually thought elbows barkins yet. Because I see I say you know, see the key results. And people will start off high elbows, the pros, you know, like you did, as opposed to like lower downDavid Nolan  58:48  lower than the elbows, essentially elbows kind of brushing along the side of your body and go behind. Because if you're up here, your shoulders are usually in a compromised position that doesn't work as well. Or if it's back down, that's more relaxed, that rolling movement. Nice. If you're doing a bent over or for example, I think what you're trying to do is you're not trying to pull the dumbbell to your chest, you're trying to draw it into your pocket. So if you were trying to you're trying to put the dumbbell into your pocket basically that your elbow is going up by your pockets and your shorts and going behind that way.Unknown Speaker  59:23  Nice nice okay guys, you got tips now for next week or tomorrow morning would you leave a doctor in the morning mean right and evening sits there about any other questions for David now because you won't be seen him for a week. So you've got leg day coming up as well. You've got Paul day, which is the back and biceps. So as any questions you've got maybe exercises you've need any. Maybe David we can do a little series on the exercises with the artists as well. DoDavid Nolan  59:49  you think so? I think that'd be a good idea. I'll just note that down for myself here. But yeah, we'll break down a couple of the key key exercises each week and kind of some, some tips of what you need to be looking out for understand?Unknown Speaker  1:00:03  So I have a very interesting bounciness Yeah, I'll find a study poster and you can read again I'm an expert in Uber I found this fascinating Kevin Kevin was in the gym now Diane squat and deadlift and under gates and cages we go good dang goes we just pumped to go train tomorrow. There's your gun. Oh, by the way, if anyone's doing yoga, candlelit yoga, chill out after this talk. So enjoy yourselvesDavid Nolan  1:00:37  much guys and again, feel free I'm in the group if you need to reach out or ask guiding don't don't hesitate at all.Unknown Speaker  1:00:46  Thanks, everyone.

Even if we look at the recommended guideline guideline. So even if you look at the governmental guide guidelines come down from the now every country has their own, but they all originate from the World Health Organization on the comedown that the current recommendations are that adults should engage in 150 minutes of moderate vigorous exercise per week, including two to three strength sessions, working on strength mobility. So that's pretty much in line with the World Health Organization's guidelines and what how much exercise we should be doing on a weekly basis.\n David Nolan  4:23  \n But it's like everything, you know, it's it's about starting at the appropriate level and then gradually building up over time like we're training, what we're doing is we're putting a stress on our body, and we hope that our body adapts positively to that stress. Now, it's a very delicate balance with stress application because, say when we talk about elite performance athletes, when we don't apply enough stress or appropriate amount of stress, we leave games on the table so they couldn't, might have got better. But an injury occurs when we place too much stress on the body for the handle at any one time. So at the extreme end, a born brain because we put too much for somebody who can't handle at a certain angle or something like that, soft tissue injuries, sort of, you know, strains niggles, groin issue hips, there tend to be a low thing we put too much stress in forms of Lord in terms of miles or time on a too quickly, or, you know, adaptation takes time. I've said plenty times where people try to rush fitness too often and you can't have a baby in four and a half months by trying twice as hard. You know, I mean, adaptation takes time.

But I got up to like, week three, and I couldn't believe how quickly my like muscles were improving how much stronger I was getting. Like from week to week, and the Dom's got less. I saw like I saw massive improvements in just a really short space time. And I didn't finish it. So that's saying something. I think if I'd finished it, I would have been like, draw super strong.

So the way we develop it sometimes and express it are different. But what you will do then, is this more strength hypertrophy side of things that we're at moment, and then a few weeks of training yourself back into, okay, I need to lift heavier again, a few weeks of retraining that skill is then you would notice kind of this potensi ation effect where the high reps for a time, then into lower reps, then testing at the end of that would probably lead to the most most benefit, I suppose, or increase in strength.\n Question: Would you?

And then that fourth session could keep the skill there. Like, what we would do in a powerlifting context, and would actually do the heavy single sometimes is what we do, where the mic when workup to a heavy session of one on a squat at like an RPh or something, and then to do three sets of sixes or back offsets or just doing that heavy single to keep the skill of lifting heavy there. And then the actual development is happening in the three sets of six on the back off.

So don't need to share the other screen. get the hang of it now. I need to share either Aha, no, no, we're going to work. So very quickly. I know some of you know me for the last challenge. But just in case you are new here this time a very brief introduction to myself and by arrogant enough to think there are one or two things about strength training. So career wise, I do quite a quite a few different things. I'm currently finishing off my PhD in applied Sport Sciences at Dublin City University and I research sex differences in resistance training. So I look at the kind of question do females respond differently to males in exercise? And do females need to train differently and some of the stuff around the role of menstrual cycle hormonal contraceptives all these do, they have Fact exercise. So that's kind of my research interests academically. I also lecture in a few different places and most probably, I lead a Master's course in sports performance analysis at portabello Institute. I am the co director of diverse strength division network. And then I am also used to be s&c and now director of education at RubyConf, Maryland. And then consultancy wise, I work with athletes from from different backgrounds, different sports and different organizations through my consultancy, synapse performance. And so again, mainly feel based sports, but also some high level combat sport athletes and as well, from my own sport and experience, I compete in powerlifting. So the squat, the bench and the deadlift for anyone to do is know those three exercises alone, if you want to call that a sport, that's pretty much my sport. And three exercises is the sport I compete in. And so that is kind of my background, in terms of some of the questions we got into semen. So three came in, and two around kind of the postpartum side of stuff. So this one, this person is almost a year postpartum, I'm struggling a bit to know what delimiter used to be very fit, but some debilitating pelvic and hip pain, from early exercise, and sometimes or from every pregnancy is sometimes paired up by axes. Now, what I will say is, we're lucky enough to have Emma Dolan on this challenge, or pre and postnatal specialists. So these are questions that I would divert to to Emma, I know a person she's excellent at what she does. And so obviously, this person has acknowledged that sort of talking about this. But if that's enough strength training, again, you're doing building up to 10k, and you're doing the two classes with me, that's gonna be pretty much enough if you are going from relatively low amounts of exercise to get them back into it, again, with pain and something like this. Once you have medical clearance to go back, that's fine. That if the exercise tends to flare it up, you just have to identify the patterns, what type of exercise flares up, what volume, if I do have to session for the full session, is it flared open, just finding where works best for you. And now there's very few cases in which we should avoid exercise altogether, that that exercise will be contraindicated. So, a lot of time, a low level of discomfort or low level of pain associated with exercise in terms of niggles, say, two or three hour 10, on the pain scale is perfectly fine. And will tend to ease itself with more exercise. So again, I'm not completely answering that question, but chat to me about this. And also Dr. P, on the nutrition he know many people know his PhD is in rehabilitation, as well around joint rehabilitation. So he will have some insights on this as well.\n", "content_length": 3676, "content_tokens": 680, "embedding": []}, {"essay_title": "Strength Seminar", "essay_url": "", "essay_date": "March 2023", "content": "That's that question. This one now, how do you know when you should progress the way. So the way we have structured it is we're working for 60 seconds. Now, we are recommended a tempo that you should be lowering the waist, the centric face for three seconds, about a one second pause, or and one second concentric, where you're pushing, and then maybe one second pause between reps. So a rep roughly should take six seconds, and five to six seconds, depending on your tempo. So that means in 60 seconds, you should be able to complete 10 to 12 reps. If you're completing more reps and that necess you're going too fast. So what you need to do is once you're able to complete 10 to 12 reps with good technique using the right tempo in a set, well, that means it's time to probably go heavier. The next you go heavier, the next session, you might do get a rep stone and that 60 seconds, you're not able to do anymore, whatever and then you try to progress it on that way. So it's best if you're able to 10 to 12 reps with good technique in the 60 seconds for all your sets, then it's ready to move up the weight. And again, you don't have used the same way it's for every set, like if we're doing two sets and as we progress three sets per exercise, you could use a heavyweight for the for session. So say for example, this week, you're able to use five kilos per hand and you got the 12 reps in bought sets. Well next week, we've said okay, I want to go to seven kilos for the first session. See if I can get the 10 reps you might only get eight. And then I'm going to drop back to five kilos for the second session and get the 10 to 12 reps so you can have those options and as well, so I hope that explains it. And then finally, another person with pelvic pain after birth to daughter and walking Making the pain worse. So is there any advice around strength training. So, depending on the difficulty of the birth, whether there was the degree of tearing, and if any, and how long after the birth, there are some considerations there. But generally, you know, hip pain might several reasons that can cause it. And Emma, again, is wanting to talk about this after birth. But a lot of what we need to do in the postnatal period is tightening everything back up, re re educating, and some of the muscles to work into it should, but also increasing pelvic floor strength, increasing the strength around the groin, and hips, and other muscles there. So, advice on how to train with it. We've suggested regressions and adaptations that can be done to the exercises. And you can ask us if any particular exercises you're having difficulty with, we'll find a way of adjusting it for you. But basically, all we're ever looking to do is a little bit of discomfort, maybe, okay, maybe, if there's something that causes pain, we find a way that we complete the exercise, while keeping the pain kind of below a three or four hour 10 is generally a rule of thumb that we do. And that might be a postural thing, it might be by elevating or, depending on the exercise by using an elevation, or something like that, we can adjust it now augment it for you. So if there's particular exercises you're struggling with, please do send us a message and I will help find what works best for you. So those are the three quick questions that came in. And a brief introduction to myself case. I don't know if we have any questions have come through Scott\n \n Unknown Speaker  21:47  \n flear, about some luck. Okay, so Mr. Dean, go on, you're on the rap side. So if we're doing between 111 to 13 reps per set, we should go up.

And also you mentioned before David by like the muscle can only get bigger or smaller it can.\n David Nolan  23:27  \n Yeah, this idea of toning again, that's a colloquialism I suppose that we use are the binocular for the muscle itself, the shape that can change but in terms of this tone, our muscles when we are born, they attack shut apartments are two points, a muscle obviously just stretches from one point to another and contracts between those two points. We can't, it's genetically predisposed, where those muscles attach. The bicep is a good example usually, and it's more prominent in males, but some people have bicep that is quite large and attaches very close to elbow. But you'll see other people have kind of these golf ball, biceps, that's just a golf ball at the top of the arm kind of thing where again, and you have you can search Google and there'll be these of you train this way to make it go further down your arm, which, again, is bullshit. It's unfortunately we're just built that way in terms of the muscle. So what can we do in terms of the appearance of a muscle? So toned, usually means you know farm and shapely is generally what we are talking about when we talk more terms that we can. It's relatively lean, defined and shapely. So when we are looking for that, we have two options. We can make the muscle bigger, or we can remove fashio that's over the muscle through diet and exercise. And that's that's pretty much as we can do boredom similar fantasy is the the ideal scenario. Or for example, if your arm is not toned, you either have to make the muscle bigger that it is more prominent and it looks more toned, or you have to reduce overall body fat stat is rubbish bit leaner on the muscle is more visually. It's more, I won't say aesthetically, but it's more prominent, visually prominent. And now what I will say is, a lot of people don't realize that if you gain muscle, so if you work on strength training and hypertrophy training, and hypertrophy founders know is just to grow the muscle, it's the fancy word we use to make ourselves sound smarter, but it's just muscle building is hypertrophy. You think about it, if you were to gain two kilos of muscle, and the amount of body fat that's in your body said the exact same. So say for argument's sake, you would 20 kg of body fat in your body. If you gain two kg muscle and you stay at 20 kg body fat, you don't gain any body fat, well, then your body fat percentage, which is what we all know is, what kind of dictates how lean you are, people want to have a lower body fat percentage, by increasing muscle and keeping your fat mass the same will then rel relative to your overall weight, your body fat percentage is actually decreased. And when body fat percentage decreases, you visually look leaner. So that's why to get leaner and to look leaner, we don't have to always lose body fat, just by even gaining muscle, it will bring down our body fat percentage, which visually will make a big difference and as well. So it's just a mindset thing to get into that we don't always have to be focused on on fat loss in order to make a biggest static difference. Now, obviously, the biggest ecstatic difference comes when you gain muscle and lose fat. So you're hitting it from both ends, essentially, that you know, you're less layers of fat on top of the muscle, bigger muscle presses up against the skin better, you look more athletic, more lean and more toned. Pretty much it in terms of the boom, again, people are more well says people like okay, well I just need to reduce the fashio on my arm doesn't work that way, in terms of our bodies, quite cruel, that we cannot spot reduce. So just by training your arms more doesn't mean that you're going to lose the fat from your arms. And when we lose body fat, we can't control where we lose it from. And again, with both males and females, it tends to be the last place or the first place you want it to go from tends to be the last place it goes from. So you know, I mean, our bodies hold fast, where it seems essential that it needs it. And in females, it's particularly around sexual organs around the hips. And the lower abdomen is tends to be where the majority of that fashio is held on to, for obvious obvious reasons. It's trying to insulate and protect the sexual organs. And so hips, glutes, everything like that. So it can be oftentimes one of the last places, if you're trying to get really lean, that tends to lose fat from\n", "content_length": 4678, "content_tokens": 911, "embedding": []}, {"essay_title": "Strength Seminar", "essay_url": "", "essay_date": "March 2023", "content": "and in terms of the bone or the glutes, as we call them. So it's always a big target muscle that people want to develop. Even in athletes. It's when we talk about sprinting and jumping a lot of its comes from the glutes. So when we talk about building a muscle people often forget, you just need to think about what the function of a muscle is. And, for example, I'll throw that out there. Can anyone tell me? What do the glutes do? Like if I asked you what the biceps do, everyone knows the bends your elbow pulls your arm? What are the glutes responsible for what movements? Do the glutes do?

Ah?\n David Nolan  29:29  \n Now, if we talk about lifting the leg again, let's think about it. Both sweet muscles do one thing. They shorten between two points to contract. That's all a muscle can do. It can contract and relaxed. When we lift the leg. What's the most saloon? What's the glutes tune. Loads are stretching so they're not contracting. They're not working. They're stretching. So that means it's the hip flexors at the front your leg, flex the hip pull up the leg so We can think about it, if that's the movement, so when you lifted your leg, you see it stretch. But then when they contract, it's the opposite way. So it's a hip extension is what the glutes are for. That's why we do a hip thrust, or in that bottom position, and we're essentially coming up and trying to push your pelvis towards the roof. Now, that is the movement. And that's why we get that at a squash when we're coming up over squash or hips are bent under trying to push back through to try to push back through and under us. When we look at our hips, hip thrusts technique, we tend to see a lot of people and I'll get some graphics of next week, we'll break down the technique of this. But a lot of people don't get the full hip extension, hip trust, and that's where they're missing out on the glutes of because people lift really, really heavy weight in the hip trust, you see people with massive amounts of weight on the hip crossbar. For them, it's because they're relying a lot on the quads, the backs, the hip flexors, that kind of stuff. When a lot of times they don't actually use the glutes as much as they can, because the glutes in the hip trust, again, how I describe it, when I teach it to people is, you should never look attractive when doing a good hip trust. If, and you should look what was there. Now, again, if anyone finds me crass, please, please stop me. A good hip truss looks offensive. If you get what I mean, a good hip truss should look offensive, that at the top, you're coming, your hips are coming up. And there's kind of this perverted, squeezing the glutes and shoving of genitalia basically towards the roof of this, that final kind of kick in the hips is really what's needed from the glutes. So again, someone said aggressive, yeah, a good hip thrusts at the top looks aggressive and offensive. And I'll get some graphics and videos of that next week to show but it's that last few little inches of the movement can actually make a big difference in Litquake can make a big difference in terms of the glute activation. So again, a lot of time, little tweaks of technique can make a big difference. Now, I hope I hope that makes sense for people and I'm not boring people with the technicalities.\n \n", "content_length": 2748, "content_tokens": 546, "embedding": []}, {"essay_title": "Strength Seminar", "essay_url": "", "essay_date": "March 2023", "content": "Unknown Speaker  32:23  \n Make sense? Makes sense. Well, does anyone have any questions on our know if anyone is doing the work we did before. Octagon remember we did glute bridges into Single Leg Glute bridges who's doing them, and you didn't use any weight and it was killer bass, because you actually probably using your glutes for the first time properly as opposed to use an under key hip thrusts it did with this leg, the Single Leg Glute Bridge is so much harder than you think like is that I mean, my glutes are weak.\n David Nolan  32:57  \n Yeah, it's, it's it's a difficult one. So when we start a new exercise, and we're bad at it, it's for two reasons. It's the muscle is weak. So and the second one is, it's a new skill. These are new movements, you learn the first time do it the first time you you swing a golf club, maybe that's a bad analogy to use here. But you're bad at. And it's not because you're weak, you can't hit the ball far enough because your technique is poor, because it's a new skill and a motor pattern you're trying to develop. So in the first week or two, you're just getting used to doing the movement. And as you get better at learning the actual movement skill of movement, then you can get better and better at developing the mind muscle connection with the muscle and getting better at isolated muscle. And that's another reason why the progress we make in the first few weeks of training, a lot of it can be down to our nervous systems or our brain getting better at coordinating the signals and our movement becomes smoother. Now, if that takes a couple of weeks to happen, and you switch your exercises every four weeks, which a lot of people do, or even you're switching exercise all the time, you never give your body enough time to learn to movement smoothly. And then start to progress in terms of the muscle has to then take up the slack even more, where because of this, we've two blocks per made. You should be competent in the movements by the end of the first block. And then in the second block, you'll really be able to push on and isolate the muscle and feel the difference there. So yeah, that's it's two aspects. And then there's a lot more core stability needed in the single like hip thrust. Because again, with all these exercises, all we are ever doing is trying to resist gravity in one way or another gravity is trying to work against us unless we're using a band or a cable or something like that. But in the hip trust essentially what gravity is trying to do is push one side your hip down, so you have to use your core glutes and everything to keep yourself balanced and level throughout the movement and as well. So it's an additional challenge.\n", "content_length": 2712, "content_tokens": 535, "embedding": []}, {"essay_title": "Strength Seminar", "essay_url": "", "essay_date": "March 2023", "content": "Unknown Speaker  35:09  \n Make sense?

So in terms of like, what we're trying to do, am I still sharing my screen? Sorry, no, I stopped around, sorry, something popped up here. So yeah, that's difference between those are the two different qualities in terms of strengths is the ability of our muscles to exert force or to resist against things to push against in support, where that other stuff is high intensity, aerobic exercise, both training our heart and her lungs. And yes, you might feel a bit of burning in the muscle. But that burning is not because when you do high intensity, say cardio exercise, or you're doing, you know, air squats, for as far as you can zones, you can, your legs will burn, but strength probably isn't your limiting factor, it's actually your aerobic system is your limiting factor, because you get a buildup of lactic acid in these other things in the muscle, and it's really burned. And it's really difficult. But that's just your breathing, it can't clear it quick enough, essentially, without going into the, the details, where when you slow it down, focus on the lower high quality reps, the muscle strengths, the the fibers that make up per muscle day or workout challenge rather than the aerobic system predominately, so yes, you're always going to have a little bit of aerobic little bit of muscle working at all times no matter what you're doing. But when we focus on this, and we're challenging the most super saying that muscle fibers in it. And then the other element to it is in order to grow. And we'll cover next week in our in our seminar, in order to progress, we have to apply something called progressive overload, and he talks about that strength is just applying stress to the body, we break down the body a little bit and we recover, we get better. But when we get better, we're now fitter. So our bodies can handle a little bit higher level of stress. And so it's like if you're running, you go out the first time you do 10 minutes kills you, then a week or two later, while you're able to do 12 minutes, if you kept just doing 10 minutes, you're going to get to a stage where you don't really progress anymore. So it's the same with strength training, we need to keep increasing the amount of stress we place on the muscles over time because our muscles are able to handle it well. And then over time, we get this progressive overload by increasing directs increasing the sets increasing the amount of weight we use, and that leads to the muscle getting stronger and stronger and stronger. Where if we're doing the high intensity, you know, just gone 100% all the time. Well, first of all, we're starting to hide that we're using the aerobic system rather than the muscles per se. And where do you progress to you know mean there's no progression progression going on? So that's a whole again come clear next week in this seminar exactly what I mean when we dig into details, but I hope that answers it to a certain degree.\n Unknown Speaker  38:41  \n And nice it does it does.

If it's about over the time that we are you know more demands are face to face that we are some degree of progression is going on. So it sounds that you're in the right place. So five kg heavy. We're just about do what? So next week, I believe we are adding another session I believe. So maybe keep five kg the same next week and see you because you won't be doing three sets with instead of two and say okay, if can I get through the three sets And is it slightly easier. So if you nail the three sets of five kg the whole way through, then the next week, go up to six, go up to seven, even if it's one or two sets, or I think we'll progress and reps after that, whatever it may be. So that's kind of where I be, we can progress in several different ways we'll talk with you. So you can add reps, you can add more ways, you can add another set, or what people tend to forget is you can do the same with reps and sets for better technique and better controller that is progression. If I'm able to, or same with the squat, if I'm only able to have the mobility to half squat this week, and then in two weeks time, I'm able to do a full squat. Well, you've gone twice the range of motion, so you've actually placed twice as much stress on your legs and glutes and everything per rep. So that's progression as well even if the way it says the same, but your range of motion becomes better or whatever it may be. That is progress as well.

So let's see, for women specifically. So women, once we hit healthy aging starts in early life and people don't get the exercise and training we do in our early life has a massive knock on effect and to lead life. So some of the things that women are more prone to in the postmenopausal stage. So when we're perimenopausal and postmenopausal, we have a massive dip in estrogen levels after the menopause. One of the implications of that is estrogen is actually very important for calcium utilizations. One of the reasons that people around menopause and after menopause you're told to supplement with with calcium and vitamin D and Vitamin K. So women are really at risk of us developing osteoporosis and osteopenia. So that's just the bones getting more fragile and bone density going down. There's one thing that really works well to increase our bone density and that is resistance training, weight bearing training astronauts in space but Because of lack of gravity, they actually lose a lot of bone. And they will try in two to three hours a day in space, just to try and preserve the bone density. So that's the big one, it really significantly reduces your risk of osteoporosis for females, specifically, females tend to be at higher risk of joint injuries more specifically around the hip and knee, especially at knee. Anyone engaged in sport, females are about three times more likely to rupture an ACL than males a couple of reasons for that. It used to be tired about the cue angle, the angle of the hip. But the science infrequent out against that, it generally just seems because women are weaker. And now I don't say that, in a misogynistic way I even see it in Sport is men tend to culturally start lifting weights at a younger age. And females participate in sport tend to not engage in resistance training, or come to it much later in life. So therefore, they have a lower training age and haven't been doing it as long. But to try to play the exact same sport, they have the same demands on the body, and the knees aren't strong enough to handle it a lot of the time. So strength training for is going to reduce your risk of injury for if you play a sports. And also if you are a runner, it will reduce your risk of running related injuries. And as well, that's to try again, with the healthy agents of it, you live longer and you live a better quality of life. Do our levels of muscular strength is strongly associated with our quality of life and our quality of life. Even with COVID I don't like talking about now. But we actually saw people with higher levels of muscular strength had less risk of hospitalization and that should COVID. So being stronger, genuine genuinely, throughout our lifespan leads to better quality of life, and more independence. Like if you're not strong enough to sit, open down over chair by yourself when you're 70 or 80. You're not strong enough to go to the toilet by yourself, you need help. It's just not good, and it's a lower quality of life. Okay. People who are embarking on weight loss journeys and fat loss doors, who engage in resistance training exercise, tend to have better outcomes than those engaged just robic exercise alone. So tends to lead to superior or at least matched weight loss outcomes compared to cardio. And okay, fifth, let me see what would be good for both why people should strength train makes you look jacked. Who doesn't want to look jacked? I don't know. Like, you don't get bigger glutes from Ronan.\n Unknown Speaker  47:53  \n Davino as a question if you do it.

We saw it was resistance training seems to have a strong effect on cognitive ability, then as well, it improves. Now all exercise do it's not just resistance or resistance seems to have a good effect on on dementia thing. And again, when you strength train, don't forget that the signals for your muscles move all originates in the brain, be it for running or for weight training, the signals have to come from the brain and as well, so the brain is always going to to be involved. And then because strength training can often be done in the gym environment or in a community based setting. It oftentimes brings a social aspect to it as well, which when we talk about cognitive ability and dementia risk and dementia, rate of decline dementia related rate of decline. People who have increased socialization tend to see better outcomes there then as well again, not not my domain. I don't want to talk too much about that kind of site itself, but it does seem to benefit us.

But when we look at people who engage in aerobic exercise, so and meet the guidelines, so get 150 minutes a week, and don't get their strength, they tend to see a I think, a 17% reduction in mortality risks, or people just dying from diseases, when you hit your 70, or your 150 minutes 70% reduction in the risk of dying, those who only meet their strength requirements, that they get to three strength training sessions in a week, they see a 21% reduction in risk of death. So do you see superior benefits compared to cardio. Now, people who get bought the cardio and strength, they see a 29% reduction in this particular study that we'll talk about next week. So those who do both see the biggest benefit, but doors if you had to choose one or the other. I would say if you said I've only three sessions to train per week, card me I would say do strength training for three sessions.

I once did 170 minutes. Nice. And then deadlift only demonstrated maybe, maybe? I don't know. Well, actually, I've never found like, I don't know if anyone else you got lower back problems. There was a comment in the, in the in the chat box of a lower back on some exercises. I always found that agitated Nancy to nominal day. To me. So my is that I think I saw a physio, maybe some a lower abdomen in my pelvis or whatever is very weak.\n David Nolan  53:39  \n So position potentially, someone did ask about a remember tips on Romanian deadlift, I think and lower back. So a lot of times with the RDL. When we see lower back discomfort, it can be a technique thing. So I'll hopefully I'll put it up in slides, I'll make a note of it with the Romanian deadlift. Again, what is our goal and if you think about this, in terms of where a muscle begins and ends, its advanced, it's nerdy, but this is what I think about the hamstrings is what we're looking to mainly work in a Romanian deadlift. And they're what we call a by articulate muscle, which again, is just a fancy way of saying it crosses two joints. So our hamstrings starts at pretty much our lower back because Prosser hip and then across our knee and attaches to the top of our calf. So if we're looking to stretch that muscle to the full capacity, are essentially trying to get the two ends of it as far away from each other as possible. Now, what people tend to do is to just bend from the back for what we're trying to do in their RDL is not bend forward. We're actually trying to push our hips back as far as we can backwards and actually create the biggest distance between the two ends of the muscle. So if you are someone that if you want to see well do I do the RDL properly about four to five inches in front of a wall. And when you're already Ellen, your bot should be touching off the wall. If your bot is not touching off the wall, that means you're bending just from the hips forward, bending from the backs rather than pushing the hips back. So you want to start your position few inches in front of the wall and focus on I'm not it's not about bending forward to keeping my my chest up straight, my body straight and pushing my hips back as far as they can behind me by bending over. So that's essentially what we're doing to troubleshoot afterward.\n", "content_length": 2366, "content_tokens": 474, "embedding": []}, {"essay_title": "Strength Seminar", "essay_url": "", "essay_date": "March 2023", "content": "Unknown Speaker  55:35  \n Nice.

But hopefully, you're feeling better. And we'll be able to get into the strength training soon. But as I said, people who are stronger tend to do better with COVID. And as well.\n Unknown Speaker  56:11  \n Yes, yes. And we've got pulled a tomorrow. So there will be a lot of this pelvic tilt movements. So any, any tips day before activating the lats for people because I know a lot of men like doing big back exercises.

But what we can do is a surrogate kind of movement, if we focus on what our shoulder blades doing and kind of our shoulders, it can be an easy way to do it. So when we are pulling back percent, you're trying to squeeze your shoulder blades and pulling movement. When we're pulling back, you're trying to either for different people or work better, you're trying to squeeze your your shoulder blades, if you're trying to squeeze the coin behind them, or most people respond best to is your elbow, you're trying to pull your elbow behind you and push your elbow as far as you can. So if I'm, if I'm pulling here, it's about you picture that you're not pulling from the hand, rather than you're pulling from the elbow, your hand is just holding on to the weight. But it's the elbow is what you're trying to bring behind you. So you know you're pulling, don't think of squeezing the biceps, because people tend to squeeze to shorten the squeeze in like this, where if I just focus on, it's the elbow was going behind, you get a better rowing movement. And that's something and also when we go forward. So a lot of people don't go forward enough. So obviously, the people think that the scapula has to be set back, and we just move like this. But really what we wanted a full stretch that were forward like that to the scapula goes the full way, and then comes back the full way. But it's important to that, why are you keeping the chest and back straight the mistake people make is when does capital forward they allow the back around with it. That's not what we're looking for. We want the chest to stay a stretch, but the scapular to move. Now, I hope that angle was okay for the camera guy didn't just make a fool of myself. Not there's laughing I don't know if she laughing at me or what's going on.\n Unknown Speaker  58:34  \n Last re release, I actually thought elbows barkins yet.

Because if you're up here, your shoulders are usually in a compromised position that doesn't work as well. Or if it's back down, that's more relaxed, that rolling movement. Nice. If you're doing a bent over or for example, I think what you're trying to do is you're not trying to pull the dumbbell to your chest, you're trying to draw it into your pocket.
